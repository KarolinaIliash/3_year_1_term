This project simulates elastic collisions between load of balls.
Firstly in fuction simpleInitApp() I initialize four balls in
different places with different speeds. Then in function simpleUpdate()
in every frame balls is moving according to their speeds. And also in 
every frame there is a check whether there are collisions. If there is
a collision function boom() calculate and set new speeds for balls.
Every 0.3 seconds(or a few milliseconds more) new ball is generated.
